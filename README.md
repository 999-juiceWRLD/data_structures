# Implementation of Data Structures

This repo contains implementations of various data structures. Trying to make this a fully functioning library where you can basically use implemented data structures as-intended. I will implement AVL & red-black trees, and hopefully graphs.

Current data structures are:
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Binary Search Tree
